# RPi4-LED-Matrix-Display
A class team project to control a 2D array of individually addressable LEDs. The LED matrix is controlled through an HTML webpage running on a local server setup on the RaspberryPi.

### Revision?
A class team project is to control a 2D array of LEDs from a web browser. The LED array is any length of individually adressable LED strip controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4B. Display settings are updated by a user connected to the local server running on the Pi through a web browser.

## Technical details
The LED matrix can be made with any length of individually adressable LED strip. The LEDs should be arranged in a snaking pattern like so:
