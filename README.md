# RPi4-LED-Matrix-Display
This is a college team project for our Raspberry Pi and Python course.

## Description:
This project controls a 2D array of individually addressable LEDs remotely through a Raspberry Pi 4B. The controls are accessed through an web page running on a local server set up on the Raspberry Pi. You can either use the LED matrix as an audio visualizer when playing media on the Raspberry Pi, or use it as a generic display and set patterns or colors.

See the requirements.txt for the list of dependecies needed to run this project.
