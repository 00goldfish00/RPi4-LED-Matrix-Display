# RPi4-LED-Matrix-Display
A class team project to control a 2D array of individually addressable LEDs. The LED matrix is controlled through an HTML webpage running on a local server setup on the RaspberryPi.

### Edits?
The goal of this project is to control a 2D array of LEDs from a web browser. The LED array is any length strip of individually adressable LEDs controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4B. Display settings are updated by a user connected to the local server running on the Pi through a web browser.
